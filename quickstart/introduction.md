# Introduction

While Road Runner was designed for FTC, the core library intentionally has no direct dependence on the FTC SDK. The FTC [quickstart](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart) exists to bridge this gap between the core library and the SDK.

The [tuning guide](tuning.md) gives comprehensive instructions for configuring your robot for Road Runner and the quickstart. The physical variation among drivetrains (e.g., wheels, drivetrain dimensions, robot weight) prevents the quickstart from working out of the box.

Before you begin experimenting with the quickstart, we strongly recommend that you walk through the [tour](../tour/introduction.md).
